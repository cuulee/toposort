Benchmarks
==========

Since I'm obsessed with performance, here is a tiny benchmark comparing the performance of the 0.3.1 version and the current version written in ES6

| Description                  | Library         | Op/s       |  %   |
|------------------------------|-----------------|-----------:|-----:|
| simple dependency chains     | 0.3.1 version   | 65,185.45  | 12%  |
|                              | current version | 535,679.89 | 100% |
| slightly more complex chains | 0.3.1 version   | 23,642.86  | 12%  |
|                              | current version | 198,397.79 | 100% |
