Benchmarks
==========

Since I'm obsessed with performance, here is a tiny benchmark comparing the performance of the 0.3.1 version and the new version written in ES6

| Description              | Library     | Op/s       |  %   |
|--------------------------|-------------|-----------:|-----:|
| simple dependency chains | old version | 28,818.96  | 14%  |
|                          | new version | 211,578.12 | 100% |
