Benchmarks
==========

Since I'm obsessed with performance, here is a tiny benchmark comparing the performance of the 0.3.1 version and the current version written in ES6

| Description                  | Library         | Op/s       |  %   |
|------------------------------|-----------------|-----------:|-----:|
| simple dependency chains     | 0.3.1 version   | 62,651.11  | 11%  |
|                              | current version | 558,703.28 | 100% |
| slightly more complex chains | 0.3.1 version   | 22,453.28  | 11%  |
|                              | current version | 209,896.48 | 100% |
