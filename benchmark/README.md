Benchmarks
==========

Since I'm obsessed with performance, here is a tiny benchmark comparing the performance of the 0.3.1 version and the new version written in ES6

| Description              | Library      | Op/s       |  %   |
|--------------------------|--------------|-----------:|-----:|
| simple dependency chains | 0.3.1        | 28,818.96  | 14%  |
|                          | 0.4.0        | 211,578.12 | 100% |
