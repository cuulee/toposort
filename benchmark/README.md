Benchmarks
==========

Since I'm obsessed with performance, here is a tiny benchmark comparing the performance of the 0.3.1 version and the current version written in ES6

| Description                  | Library         | Op/s       |  %   |
|------------------------------|-----------------|-----------:|-----:|
| simple dependency chains     | 0.3.1 version   | 65,897.92  | 17%  |
|                              | current version | 378,468.10 | 100% |
| slightly more complex chains | 0.3.1 version   | 25,827.17  | 16%  |
|                              | current version | 165,029.58 | 100% |
